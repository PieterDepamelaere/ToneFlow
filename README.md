# ToneFlow
MIDI Driven Concert Software (Each participant has to play only one note/fingering, no thorough musical skills needed. Created with Kivy and KivyMD)

EDIT 2019/10/02: (WIP) This is a personal hobby project. The intention was to come up with a platform independent (Windows, MacOS, Linux, Raspbian) python application that - in the end - will run on a Raspberry Pi 3B. The underlying goal is to try whether it would be possible to play music together with people who weren't taught any music-education or having mental limitations.

My intention is to give every member of a scouting group (devoted to people with all sorts of mental disorders) a recorder flute (plastic ones 4eur/pp which can be washed afterwards), and to print fingering charts of the notes on the same color of paper as the corresponding bar that slides down in the screen. The default colorsheme will be made compliant with the boomwhackers-method, so one can easily try such instruments as well.
